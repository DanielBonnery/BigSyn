\title{Save a pdf image of each regression tree grown in the modeling phase and discard useless information}
\usage{
compilefits(
  Sparameters,
  fitmodelsavepath,
  pdfpath = fitmodelsavepath,
  .progress = "text"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pdfpath}{where to save the pdfs}

\item{Sparameters:}{a list, that has the same structure than the outputs of}

\item{fitmodelsavepath:}{a file path where to store the pdf of the plot}

\item{.progress:}{a string, name of the progress bar to use, see plyr::create_progress_bar}
}
\description{
For each element of save parameters, look at the tree and produces the corresponding pdf.  It also removes all the information that is stored in the ouptut of parykit::Ctree, e.g. the data. It only keeps the tree and the rules to get it.
}
\details{
Depends on plyr. Partykit output contain all the data that was used to grow the tree. this function removes the unwanted information.
}
\examples{
y=iris$Species;x=iris[,-5]
partykitctree <- partykit::ctree(y ~ ., data=cbind(y=y,x))
}
